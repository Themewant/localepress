/**
 * Opens a dropdown switcher on the side of it that has room.
 *
 * The stylesheet takes the panel out of flow and opens it downward, which is
 * right wherever there is space below. A switcher near the bottom of the page —
 * a footer being only the most common case — has none: the panel hangs past the
 * end of the document, the scrollable area grows, and the page visibly bounces.
 * There is no way to ask CSS how much room an element has, so the measurement
 * happens here and the answer is written back as data attributes the stylesheet
 * reads.
 *
 * The summary's click is taken over rather than watched. A `details` element
 * fires `toggle` asynchronously, so a listener on it runs after the browser has
 * already painted the panel in the wrong direction — one frame down, then up,
 * which is the jump itself. Opening it here keeps the decision and the opening
 * in a single task, so the first paint is already correct.
 *
 * Nothing here is required for the switcher to work: where this does not run,
 * every panel opens downward, exactly as it did before.
 *
 * Browser APIs used beyond ES5: `Element.closest`, `Element.matches`,
 * `HTMLElement.dataset`, `window.requestAnimationFrame`, and passive event
 * listeners. Each is guarded or optional, so an engine without one degrades to
 * the stylesheet's own downward panel rather than failing.
 *
