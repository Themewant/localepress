/**
 * Writes the language cookie from the browser on a page-cached site.
 *
 * PHP cannot write it there: the response that would have carried the header is
 * a stored copy, and on the one request that is rendered the header is stored
 * with the page and replayed to every later reader. Writing it here makes it per
 * reader again, exactly as an uncached response would have.
 *
 * The cookie this builds is the one PHP would have sent — same name, path,
 * domain, lifetime, and flags — so the two describe one cookie rather than two
 * under the same name. Its values arrive in `window.localePressLanguageCookie`,
 * printed by the enqueue that loads this file.
