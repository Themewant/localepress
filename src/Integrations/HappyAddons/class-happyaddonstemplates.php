/**
 * Reads and rewrites the Happy Addons Theme Builder state that names a language.
 *
 * Happy Addons keeps every header, footer, single and archive template in a
 * `ha_library` post, and decides which one fills a location by matching display
 * conditions written as paths — `include/general`, `include/singular/page/42`.
 * Two things in that state belong to one language. The template itself is
 * written in a language, and `42` is a page that has a translation of its own.
 *
 * The builder matches those conditions without ever asking which language it is
 * rendering, then fills each location with the first template that matched. So a
 * site holding an English and a Bengali header on the same "Entire Site"
 * condition hands whichever was recorded first to every reader. This class
 * answers which template belongs to the language being read, and what a copied
 * condition means once it moves to another language. Deciding when to ask those
 * questions is HappyAddonsModule's job.
 *
 * The condition path is Elementor's own shape, which is why rewriting one is
 * delegated rather than repeated: the builder inherited the format, so a
 * condition naming a page means here exactly what it means there.
