 * Reads and writes the language a template part slug carries.

 * A block theme chooses a template part by slug and nothing else, so the slug is
 * the only place a language can be written where the choice is being made. A
 * part in the default language keeps the name the theme gave it — `header` — and
 * every other language suffixes it: `header___bn`.
 *
 * Leaving the default language unsuffixed is what makes a fallback possible in
 * one query. A request can ask for `header___bn` and `header` together and take
 * whichever comes first, so a language nobody has written this part for renders
 * the part the site already had rather than nothing at all.
 *
 * Three underscores, because a dash is what theme authors use to tell two parts
 * apart — `header-small`, `header-dark` — and a theme shipping one of those
 * beside a language whose identifier matched would find it read as a
 * translation. Nothing is named with three underscores by accident.
