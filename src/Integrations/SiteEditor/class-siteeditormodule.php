/**
 * Renders a block theme's header and footer in the language being read.
 *
 * A block theme names its header inside the template, as
 * `<!-- wp:template-part {"slug":"header"} /-->`, and WordPress turns that slug
 * into a part with one query. That query is where a language can be applied,
 * because it is the moment the choice is made and the only moment at which both
 * candidates are still available.
 *
 * So the query is asked for both: the slug in the language being read and the
 * slug as the template wrote it, ordered so the translation wins. A language
 * nobody has written this part for therefore renders the part the site already
 * had, in one query, with no second lookup and nothing to cache.
 *
 * Swapping the part swaps everything inside it at once, which is why the header
 * is the only thing that needs translating: the navigation, the logo, and the
 * switcher inside it come along.
