 *
 * Writing the language into the slug buys a fallback in one query, and the price
 * is that the slug has to stay true. Three things can make it false, and each of
 * them is answered here.
 *
 * A template can be given a language, or be created already carrying one: the
 * Site Editor lets someone duplicate a header and name it anything. One in the
 * default language must then lose any suffix, and one in another language must
 * gain one, or the query that looks for `header___bn` finds nothing.
 *
 * The default language can change. Everything then has to be renamed at once,
 * because the unsuffixed name belongs to whichever language is default, and the
 * language that was default has to take a suffix it never had.
 *
 * And a template can be deleted. Deleting the one every other language falls
 * back to leaves translations pointing at something that is gone, so the group
 * goes with it.
 *
 * One of these runs per translated type — parts and templates each get their
 * own, because each holds its own slugs and its own groups.
