 * The language state of the templates that answer a request.

 * that has to be laid out differently in another language: a right-to-left
 * single, an archive that drops a column, a 404 that says something else. That
 * is not a part; it is the template itself.
 *
 * Everything about holding the language is the same as for a part, so it lives
 * in BlockTemplates. What differs is how WordPress arrives at one of these, and
 * that is not this class's business either: a template is chosen by walking a
 * hierarchy rather than by a slug someone wrote, so the language is applied to
 * the hierarchy — see TemplateResolver.
 *
 * What is left here is the type itself, and the sentences that name it.
