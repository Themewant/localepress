 * site that is one menu too few: the same location has to answer with a
 * different menu in every language. LocalePress already stores that mapping and
 * applies it when a menu is rendered, but the assignment could only be made on
 * the LocalePress settings screen, away from the menu being edited.
 *
 * This offers the same assignment where an editor expects to find it. While the
 * menus screen or the customizer is open, each registered location is presented
 * once per language, so "Primary Menu" becomes "Primary Menu English" and
 * "Primary Menu Bengali", and the checkbox beside a menu assigns it for that one
 * language. What is saved is read back out of those locations and stored the way
 * the settings screen stores it, so both screens describe the same site.
 *
 * The default language keeps the location key the theme registered, so a theme
 * asking for `primary` is answered whether or not LocalePress is active.
