/**
 * Resolves the language an AJAX or REST request is answering in.
 *
 * A rendered page says which language it is in through its own address. The two
 * request kinds that produce part of a page without being one — admin-ajax.php
 * and the REST API — live at a fixed address that belongs to no language. Left
 * at that, everything they return is written in the default language while the
 * reader is looking at another one: a filtered listing, a "load more" page of
 * posts, a block previewed in the editor.
 *
 * Each kind is given the signals it can be trusted to carry.
 *
 * A REST collection is a public interface, and what it answers has to depend on
 * what the caller asked for and nothing else. Only an explicit language is read
 * there: the `lang` argument on the request, or the one the dispatcher captured
 * from a body the argument could not be read from before dispatch.
 *
 * admin-ajax.php is the opposite. It is never called on its own; a page calls
 * it, and that page names a language in its own address. So an explicit
 * argument is read first, and then the page that made the call is asked. That
 * is what lets a theme or plugin which has never heard of LocalePress answer in
 * the right language without changing a line.
 *
 * The visitor's language cookie is deliberately not read. It records the last
 * language the visitor chose, which is not the same question: while the default
 * language goes unprefixed, a reader who once visited a prefixed language still
 * carries that cookie on every page of the default one, and a call made from
 * such a page would be answered in a language the reader is not looking at. The
 * calling page cannot be wrong about itself, so it is the only page signal used.
 *
 * Administration calls are excluded. A wp-admin screen answers in the
 * administration's own language and has a language filter of its own, so
 * reading a visitor's language here would fight that filter rather than help
 * it. A call that names no language is left exactly as it was before this class
 * existed, which is what keeps every screen that has always worked working.
